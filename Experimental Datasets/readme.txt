All three experimental datasets were kindly provided by the Schlierf lab (BCUBE, Dresden, D).

The datafiles contain 3 columns: time, donor intensity, acceptor intensity.
The traces contain the non-bleached part only.
They were background corrected by subtracting the mean intensities after bleaching of donor & acceptor.
No further corrections were performed, which is sufficient for kinetic analyses.
For each inferred kinetic state, please specify the uncorrected FRET efficiency, aka. proximity ratio:
proximity ratio = I_A/(I_A+I_D)
In words: the acceptor intensity normalized by the sum of acceptor plus donor intensity.
