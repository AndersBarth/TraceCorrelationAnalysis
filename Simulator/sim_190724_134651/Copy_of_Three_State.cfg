	%transition rates (NOT transition probablities)
	%rows: start state
	%cols: end states
	%for states and row/col number, counting starts with 1
	%for example q_{32}=+0.400 is the rate to go from state 3 to state 2
	%matrix has to be NxN (where N is number of states) and rows have to sum to zero
	%in units of 1/s



%frameRate

	%frame rate in units of 1/s

%lookupCollapse
1	2	3

	%vector that connects states to degenerate states
	%for example "1 1 2 2" means that states 1 and 2 are mapped to the degenerate state 1
	%and states 3 and 4 are both mapped to degenerate state 2
	%if no collapse is needed, just use 1 2 3 ... N

%include blinking
0
	%flag to include blinking of dyes in the simulation (0 don't include, 1 include)

	%per matrix: covariance matrix for each (degenerate) state
	%rows, cols: in the same channel order as for the mean intensity
	%in this example the distribution of each intensity channel in each degenerate state has a width (sigma of a normal dist) of 1000
	%and no correlation with other channels, thus 1000^2 on the diagonal



%per trace level variability
0
	%parameter that controls per trace level heterogeneity
	%the intensity level for each state and intensity channel is drawn
	%from a normal distribution with mu as given in <fluorescence intensity, mean>
	%and a sigma that is sqrt(mu)*parameter
	%turn off by setting to 0



%per trace brightness variability
0
	%parameter that controls per trace brightness heterogeneity
	%an uniformly distributed random number r is drawn from the interval (-1, 1)
	%and all intensities of the current molecule are multiplied by n^r;
	%thus a per trace variability perameter of 2 would result in a 
	%multiplication by a factor from the interval (0.5, 2)
	%turn off by setting to 0
