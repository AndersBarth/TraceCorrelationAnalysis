%transition rate matrix
-1.000	+1.000
+0.666	-0.666

	%transition rates (NOT transition probablities)
	%rows: start state
	%cols: end states
	%for states and row/col number, counting starts with 1
	%for example q_{21}=+0.666 is the rate to go from state 2 to state 1
	%matrix has to be NxN (where N is number of states) and rows have to sum to zero
	%in units of 1/s



%frameRate
10

	%frame rate in units of 1/s



%bleachRate
0.01

	%bleach rate in units of 1/s



%minimum trace length
10

	%minimum trace length in seconds



%lookupCollapse
1	2

	%vector that connects states to degenerate states
	%for example "1 1 2 2" means that states 1 and 2 are mapped to the degenerate state 1
	%and states 3 and 4 are both mapped to degenerate state 2
	%if no collapse is needed, just use 1 2 3 ... N



%fluorescence intensity, mean
7000	3000	10000	%(degenerate) state 1
3000	7000	10000	%(degenerate) state 2

	%rows: intensity for channels Idd, Ida and Iaa
	%cols: (degenerate) states
	%make sure Idd+Ida=const for all (degenerate) states



%fluorescence intensity, covariance matrix
64e4	0		0	%(degenerate) state 1
0		64e4	0
0		0		64e4

64e4	0		0	%(degenerate) state 2
0		64e4	0
0		0		64e4

	%per matrix: covariance matrix for each (degenerate) state
	%rows, cols: in the same channel order as for the mean intensity
	%in this example the distribution of each intensity channel in each degenerate state has a width (sigma of a normal dist) of 1000
	%and no correlation with other channels, thus 1000^2 on the diagonal



%per trace variability
0

	%parameter that controls the multiplicator of the signal
	%an uniformly distributed random number r from the interval (-1, 1) is chosen
	%the signal is multiplied by n^r, thus a per trace variability perameter of 2 results in a multiplication by a factor in the interval (0.5, 2)
	%turn off by setting 0



%number of traces
100
